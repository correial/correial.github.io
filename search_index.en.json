To connect I had to select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE. Then, to test the connection and explore the Arduino environment I completed the following assigned example sketches in the Arduino IDE:\n\nBasics_blink\nApollo3_serial\nApollo3_analogRead\nPDM_microphoneOutput\n\nBlink\nYou can see the Artemis board flash a bright blue led\n\nBlink test video\nSerial\nHere we can see the Artemis recieves the string and echos it back\n\nSerial output test\nanalogRead Temperature Sensor\n\nTemperature sensor test\nMicrophone Output\nFrom the video you can see the Artemis microphone successfully picking up the difference in sounds in the serial monitor\n\nMicrphone output test\nLab 1b\nCodebase and BLE Discussion\nSTILL NEED TO DO THIS\nConfigurations and Setup\n\n\nI started with installing venv: python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv\n\n\nI created the “FastRobots_ble” virtual environment inside my project directory: python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble\n\n\nI activated the virtual environment: source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate\n\n\nI downloaded the provided ble_robot_1.2 codebase into my project directory\n\n\nIt is now time to start the Jupyter server: jupyter lab\n\n\nUpdated the Artemis MAC Address on the Computer. Run the ble_arduino.ino file in the Arduino IDE and check the serial monitor the MAC address:\n\n\n\nMAC Address\n\nGenerate new UUID: run from uuid import uuid4 and uuid4(). Input the generated UUID into the #define BLE_UUID_TEST_SERVICE line in ble_arduino.ino and into the ble_service: line in connections.yaml\n\n\nconnections.yaml\n\nble_arduino.ino\n\nConnect to the Artemis Nano via BLE\n\n\n\nSuccessful BLE Connection\nTask 1\nI sent a string value from my computer to the Artemis board using the  ECHO command and the computer recieved and printed an augmented string\nArduino Code:\n\nJupyter Lab Code:\n\n\n\nECHO Output\nTask 2\nI sent three floats to the Artemis board using the SEND_THREE_FLOATS command and extracted the three floats in the Arduino sketch\nArduino Code:\n\nJupyter Lab Code:\n\n\nSEND_THREE_FLOATS Output\nTask 3\nI added a GET_TIME_MILLIS which makes the robot reply write a string to the string characteristic. Note that GET_TIME_MILLIS had to be added to the cmd_types.py file.\n\nTask 4\nI setup a notification_handler function to receive the string value from the Artemis board and, in the callback function, extract the time from the string.\n\n\n\n\nNotification Handler Output\nTask 5\nI made a twenty-five step loop that gets the current time in milliseconds using the GET_TIME_MILLIS function to then be processed by notification_handler(). From my output shown below you can see that there was an average 33.5 ms gap between the prints. This translates to 29.85 message transmissions per second. With each message being 9 bytes, this results an effective data transfer rate of 269 bytes per second for this method.\n\n\nGET_TIME_MILLIS Loop Output\nTask 6\nI created a command SEND_TIME_DATA that loops though to add generated time steps via the millis() function and then stores them in an array. Then, in SEND_TIME_DATA I loop through the array and send each data point as a string to my laptop to be processed.\nArduino Code\n\nJupyter Code:\n\n\nSEND_TIME_DATA Output\nTask 7\nTask 8\nDiscussion and Conclusion (Lab 1A &amp; 1B)\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/Fast Robots/lab-2/","title":"Lab 2:","description":null,"body":"Test\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/","title":"About Me","description":null,"body":"\n  Lucca Correia\n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nJunior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Robotics.\nHere on campus I am on the Cornell Nexus Project Team as well as the Cornell United Soccer Club Team.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/nexus/","title":"Test Me","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/resume/","title":"Resume","description":null,"body":"\n","path":null}]
