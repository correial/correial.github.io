Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.\nSomething was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.\nBut as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.\nAll of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/blog/long-long-man/","title":"Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Loooooong Man","description":null,"body":"\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.

The reason for not putting the sources in the same repo as Duckquill itself is simple: I want it to be as small as possible, so that repo cloning is fast and doesn’t make the site significantly heavier; this is also why the demo uses remote images instead of local copies.\nCredits\n\nQuill image used in the metadata card\n\nTools Used\n\nVSCodium - Free/Libre Open Source Software Binaries of VS Code\n\nCapitalize - Title capitalization without random websites.\nEven Better TOML - For config.toml basically.\nMonokai Pro - Awfully pretty theme.\nPX to REM - Easy conversion from PX to REM and vice versa.\nSCSS IntelliSense - Not sure if it actually works. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nSort CSS - A lifesaver for long CSS properties.\nTera - Tera template engine (the one Zola uses) support.\n\n\nFirefox developer tools - Best of its kind.\n\nAs for the code formatter I use built-in VSCodium one. Prettier is good but I don’t like how it tries to make code fit in a very narrow column, this can be changed of course, but built-in formatter does it’s job so I don’t bother doing so.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/mods/","title":"Mods","description":null,"body":"Mods enhance/change some Duckquill visuals.

Removes shadow, rounded corners and zoom on hover.\nstart: Float image to the start of paragraph and scale it down.\nend: Float image to the end of paragraph and scale it down.\npixels: Uses nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.\ntransparent: Removes rounded corners and shadow, useful for images with transparency.\nno_hover: Removes zoom on hover.\nspoiler: Blurs image until hovered over/pressed on, useful for plot rich game screenshots.\nspoiler with solid: Ditto, but makes the image completely hidden.\n\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\nImage with compressed version, an alt text, and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text, hidden behind a spoiler\n\nAlternatively, you can append the following URL anchors.

Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.\nAs with the earlier reed pen (and later dip pen), a quill has no internal ink reservoir and therefore needs to periodically be dipped into an inkwell during writing. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool anymore because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and would quickly wear a quill down. However it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who have noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.\nKeyboard Input (&lt;kbd&gt;)\n\nTo switch the keyboard layout, press ⌘ Super + Space.\nMark Text (&lt;mark&gt;)\n\nYou know what?
