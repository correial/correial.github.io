Over the semester, I designed and fabricated a fast autonomous car with dynamic system modeling and reactive control via integrating gyroscope and time-of-flight sensor feedback on an embedded processor. The course also explored the advantages of partial off-board computation, low-latency software, and noise-tolerant implementation.\nFor detailed documentation of each lab with code reference my\nFast Robots site.\nHighlights from Each Lab\nBelow are highlights from each lab building up to the final lab where I achieved fully autonomous navigation and path planning via real time localization and linear/angular PID control.\nLab 1\nLab 2\nLab 3\nLab 4\nLab 5\nLab 6\nLab 7\nLab 8\nLab 9\nLab 10\nLab 11\nLab 12\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/Portfolio/cornell-nexus/","title":"Cornell Nexus","description":null,"body":"Cornell Nexus is a Cornell Engineering Project team currently working on a fully autonamous beach rover to address environmental concerns associated with microplastic pollution.
