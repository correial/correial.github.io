I joined the lab during my first semester of senior year and began working on one of the lab’s three robotic platforms, Gammabot, where I am designing and developing a dynamic braking mechanism for the robot. Gammabot is an insect-scale flapping-wing robot that skims along the air–water interface, leveraging centimeter-scale fluid–structure interactions to enable controlled interfacial locomotion.\nFinal Report\nBelow is the final report for my senior design project. The remainder of this page summarizes the work and results detailed in the paper. My Systems M.Eng project picks up where this paper leaves off; current progress will be added later in the semester.\n\nSummary\n\nComplete Experimental Prototype\n\n\nMotivation: A key limitation of the existing Gammabot platform is braking, as the wings cannot provide reverse thrust and the robot relies almost entirely on passive drag, limiting stopping performance and precise station-keeping.\n\n\nPerformance Metrics: The braking system is designed to slow the robot from a measured top speed of approximately 0.7 m/s to within 5% of that value over a stopping distance of 6 cm, approximately one body length, to enable reliable robot-to-robot communication.\n\n\nDesign Constraints: The brake must preserve interfacial operation, avoid disrupting or breaking the water surface, and remain compatible with the mass, size, and geometry constraints of the insect-scale robotic platform.\n\n\nDesign Approach: A passive, drag-based water brake is employed, using a lightweight carbon-fiber flat plate partially submerged in water to leverage hydrodynamic form drag rather than aerodynamic or surface-tension-dominated effects.\n\n\nModeling Framework: Braking behavior is characterized using a lumped drag constant extracted from velocity–distance data, enabling direct comparison between analytical predictions and experimental results.\n\n\nExperimental Validation: The braking mechanism is evaluated experimentally using controlled interfacial tests, demonstrating measurable increases in effective drag and reduced stopping distance relative to a no-brake baseline.\n\n\nAnalysis and Modeling\nThe braking behavior is modeled using a quadratic drag framework, in which the braking force scales with the square of velocity and the projected wetted area of the brake. This formulation leads to an exponential decay of velocity as a function of distance traveled along the water surface. Rather than explicitly modeling every hydrodynamic effect, a single lumped drag constant, (K), is used to capture the combined influence of brake geometry, wetted area, fluid properties, and unmodeled losses. This approach allows braking performance to be characterized using a single physically meaningful parameter that can be directly extracted from experimental data and compared across different brake depths. The full analytical derivation underlying this model is provided in the accompanying report.\nPrototype Design and CAD\nThe braking mechanism was designed to mount directly to the existing Gammabot chassis while allowing rapid adjustment of brake immersion depth. A pin-slot architecture enables discrete depth settings without redesigning the surrounding structure, facilitating efficient experimental iteration.\n\n  \n    \n    Full CAD assembly of the braking system\n  \n  \n    \n    Brake plate CAD geometry\n  \n  \n    \n    Brake mounting schematic\n  \n\nFabrication &amp; Assembly\nAll brake components were fabricated from carbon-fiber–resin laminate stock using laser cutting. This manufacturing method enabled precise control over geometry while maintaining low mass and high stiffness. Laser parameters were tuned to ensure clean edges and consistent hole dimensions for the pin-slot mechanism.\n\nLaser cutting brake plate\nAssembly was performed under magnification due to the small scale of the components. Hydrophobic coatings were locally removed prior to adhesive bonding to ensure reliable joints. The brake plate and mounting brackets were then installed sequentially to achieve the desired immersion depth.\n\n  \n    \n    (a) Remove coating\n  \n  \n    \n    (b) Apply glue\n  \n  \n    \n    (c) Place pin-slot brackets\n  \n\nExperimental Setup\nExperiments were conducted in a shallow water tank with the magnetic rail spanning the test region. A magnetic test rail is used to constrain the robot to one-dimensional motion while minimizing friction during braking experiments. Diamagnetic levitation supports the robot and provides lateral stability, allowing measured deceleration to be attributed primarily to hydrodynamic drag. The robot was accelerated using a controlled air impulse before entering the braking region. High-speed video was used to track robot position, from which velocity–distance data were extracted for analysis.\n\n  \n    \n    Inside-view of magnetic rail\n  \n  \n    \n    Side-view of magnetic rail\n  \n\nResults\n\n\nModel fit quality: Velocity–distance data from two trials at each brake depth are well captured by an exponential decay model, as evidenced by consistently high R² values across both braked and unbraked conditions.\n\n\nBraked vs. unbraked comparison: Aggregated fitted decay constants show a clear separation between conditions, with braked trials exhibiting a mean decay constant of approximately 17.27 compared to approximately 3.16 for no-brake trials, corresponding to roughly a fivefold increase in effective drag due to the brake.\n\n\nDepth dependence: For both braked depths, the fitted decay constant is smaller than the ideal value predicted by design calculations, reflecting real hydrodynamics, tank constraints, and unmodeled losses; however, variation in the decay constant between the two brake depths is limited, despite the expectation that increased wetted area would yield a larger value.\n\n\nInitial velocity sensitivity: Starting velocities are relatively consistent within each condition. Thus although the no-brake trials begin at approximately 2.5× higher initial velocity than the braked trials, the fitted decay constants within each group remain tightly clustered, indicating weak sensitivity of the decay constant to modest changes in initial velocity.\n\n\nStopping distance metric: The distance required to reach 5% of the initial velocity is nearly constant across braked depths and approximately one third of the unbraked value, demonstrating a substantial reduction in stopping distance due to the brake.\n\n\n\n5 mm brake depth data\n\n2 mm brake depth data\n\nNo-brake baseline data\n\nAll trials with normalized velocity\nConclusions and Next Steps\nThe results demonstrate that a compact, passive water brake can significantly improve stopping performance for an interfacial robot. While experimental drag constants did not fully meet analytical targets due to speed and setup limitations, observed trends strongly support the underlying model. Current work is now focusing on achieving higher initial velocities and implementing an actuated braking mechanism to enable on-demand deployment and improved control authority.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/Portfolio/foundation-robotics/","title":"Foundation Robotics","description":null,"body":"This past summer (2025), I had the opportunity to intern at Foundation, a rapidly growing humanoid robotics startup in San Francisco.

Since joining freshman year (2022), I’ve contributed to both the filtration and drivetrain projects, and last year in 2024 I led the fourteen-member mechanical team as Subteam Lead. In that role, I not only guided technical mechanical design but also stepped into a systems engineering position, defining system-level requirements, coordinating across electrical and software teams, and integrating subsystems onto the robot to ensure they worked seamlessly together. Below are a few highlights from the projects I’ve contributed to and supervised.\nDrivetrain Mechanical Design\nI recently redesigned our drivetrain to overcome the limitations of tank steering on sand. Last year, I built a prototype with a front-mounted swerve module and a simplified rear drivetrain. Tank drive struggles in granular terrain because turning relies on lateral skidding, which the sand resists, causing energy loss, wheel sinkage, and high current draw. By adding swerve steering, the wheels align with the direction of travel, improving traction and efficiency on soft surfaces.\nA few key design elements:\n\nBelt-driven turning mechanism to significantly reduce stress on the steering motor shaft\nDual-bearing support to minimize load on the drive motor shaft\nMotor enconder mounted on drive shaft for all motors\nStainless steel shaft + coupler to stiffen the motor output interface\nCustom wheel hub for easy tire removal\nUpper bearing connection between the rigid top plate and rotating swerve module\nIntegrated belt tensioner for reliable operation and easier belt replacment\n\n\n  \n    \n    Simplified Swerve CAD\n  \n  \n    \n    Left Swerve Module\n  \n  \n    \n    Rear Drivetrain CAD\n  \n  \n    \n    Left Rear Drivetrain\n  \n\nSystems Engineering / Integration\nThroughout my three years on Nexus I not only worked on technical projects but also took on a leadership systems engineering and integration role. I worked across mechanical, electrical, and software teams to set system-level requirements and semesterly test cases to ensure subsystems worked together reliably and motivate constant robot progress. Beyond defining performance targets and interfaces, I also supported integration and troubleshooting to bring everything onto the robot as a cohesive system.\nFiltration\nOur electrostatic filtration system uses image forces at high voltage to separate microplastics from sand on a grounded drum. I contributed by outlining and defining system-level requirements as well as proposing key testing variables and design tradeoffs. In parallel, I collaborated with the intake team to design an Archimedean screw mechanism that lifts sand from the ground and delivers it to the filtration unit. Together, these subsystems are integrated and have demonstrated effective performance in testing.\n\n  \n    \n    Electrostatic Filter Testing Jig (No Bucket)\n  \n  \n    \n    Electrostatic Filter Testing Jig CAD (No Bucket)\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n    Electrostatic Filter CAD\n  \n  \n    \n    Conveyor Between Intake and Electrostatic Filter CAD\n  \n\nElectromechanical Integration\nIn addition to mechanical project integration, as subteam lead I also directed the electromechanical integration effort, ensuring independently developed subsystems were mounted securely for sand testing. I worked with the electrical team to position critical components: motor drives, encoders, battery, GPS RTK antennas, kill switch, and PDB so they were both robustly supported and accessible to software. For example, I collaborated on custom mounts to place the battery at the optimal center of mass while accommodating surrounding electronics. Ongoing work also focuses on protecting sensitive electronics from the high-voltage electrostatic filter.\n\nConveyor Between Intake and Electrostatic Filter CAD\n","path":null},{"url":"https://correial.github.io/Portfolio/frc-robotics/","title":"Horace Mann FRC High School Robotics Team","description":null,"body":"The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a rigorous international high school engineering program where teams design, build, and program large-scale robots to complete complex game challenges under strict time, budget, and technical constraints.
