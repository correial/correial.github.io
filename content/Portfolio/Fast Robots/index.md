This page showcases my work in MAE 4190 Fast Robots, a course centered on the systems-level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots. Over the semester, I designed and fabricated a fast autonomous car with dynamic system modeling and reactive control via integrating gyroscope and time-of-flight sensor feedback on an embedded processor. The course also explored the advantages of partial off-board computation, low-latency software, and noise-tolerant implementation. 

## Highlights from Each Lab

Below are highlights from each lab building up to the final lab where I achieved fully autonomous navigation and path planning via real time localization and linear/angular PID control. For detailed documentation of each lab with code reference my

### Lab 5: Linear PID Control and Linear Interpolation

#### Key Takeaways: 

- Implemented BLE command PID_CONTROL to send PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) and target ToF distance to the Artemis.
- Developed pid_speed_ToF() function with logic for tolerance, saturation, motor deadband, and direction switching.

- Found ToF sampling limited to ~9.24 Hz, causing discrete jumps in derivative term.
- Implemented extrapolation to achieve ~172 Hz loop speed, interpolating distances between ToF readings.
- Verified with PD + extrapolation (Kp = 0.2, Kd = 3): robot could start 2.7 m from wall and still stop at 1 ft target without overshoot.
- Demonstrated near-zero steady-state error at higher speeds, eliminating need for integral term.
