This page showcases my work in MAE 4190 Fast Robots, a course centered on the systems-level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots. Over the semester, I designed and fabricated a fast autonomous car with dynamic system modeling and reactive control via integrating gyroscope and time-of-flight sensor feedback on an embedded processor. The course also explored the advantages of partial off-board computation, low-latency software, and noise-tolerant implementation.
