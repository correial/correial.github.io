This past summer (2025) I had the incredible opportunity of interning at Foundation, a startup humanoid robotics company based out of San Fransisco, CA. During my time there I worked as an extremely hands on mechanica/robotics engineer where I designed manufacturing fixtures and was partially responsible for the assembly, workflow, debugging, and build instructions of entire Phantom 1 Humanoids. Below are a few internship highlights:

## Humanoid Assembly & Debugging
- Independently completed the assembly of entire Phantom MK1 Humanoids including structures, linkages, motor encoder soldering, power and signal harnesses fabrication, actuator calibration
- Complete initial robot bring-up via simulation that involved URDF visualization and actuator signals
- Worked on manufacturing floor to complete humanoid repairs and often independent debugging

## Manufacturing Design Projects
- Designed various manufacturing and work holding fixtures in OnShape for CNC milling. Examples include a jig to clamp down actuator encoder magnet rings to be milled down as well as an ankle zeroing fixture to establish neutral ankle position during bring-up 
- Utilized CAM software to generate GCODE paths for the various work holding fixtures
- Set up and operated 3-axis CNC mill for fabrication of the jobs

The **encoder magnet rings** were one of my key design and machining projects. The team needed a repeatable process to remove a 3 mm bore and, if required, enlarge the ID to 11 mm. My contributions included:
- **Fixture Design:** Created a CNC fixture in CAD to clamp the magnet ring without damaging the encoder magnet. Key features included a pedestal to protect the magnet, precise pocket depth for clamping, minimal offset between clamp surfaces to prevent deformation, and a transition-fit pocket for accurate alignment.
- **CAM & Machining of Fixture:** Generated tool paths, researched feeds/speeds, selected appropriate bits, and programmed GCODE for the mill.
- **Ring Modification:** Machined AISI 430 housings using a 4-flute ¼″ TiAlN-coated carbide end mill with conservative depth-of-cut parameters. Programed a circular toolpath in CAM followed by a larger diameter bit for a 70 µm finishing pass.
- **Documentation:** Authored detailed work instructions for technicians to reliably repeat the modification process.

    <h2>Work Instructions and Workflow Process</h2>
    <p>
      While completing humanoid assembly, I developed comprehensive CAD-based build 
      instructions and an assembly workflow for the entire lower body. I collaborated 
      with process engineers and technicians to gather feedback and refine both the 
      instructions and overall workflow for efficiency and clarity.
