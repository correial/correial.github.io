During high school Senior summer and school year I completed a virtual internship with startup Drake Labs & strategic partner Orbital Composites. As part of my internship and Senior Thesis for the Horace Mann Science Reserach Program, I indepenetly designed, developed, machined, and programed a custom automated tensile tester to quantify deformation in Continous Carbon Fiber (CCF) Drake Labs LORE 3D Printed bike shoe.

### Summary
- Designed and completely in house manufactured a custom automated tensile and compression tester with the goal of quantifying the integrity of a 3D printed continuous carbon fiber bike shoe
- 1/4in steel stock slabs were machined to provide clearance for metal struts. Struts were welded to top slab with bottom was free to glide vertically for a variety of mounting heights.
- Main electrical components were a raspberry pie, a “main circuit” to control the actuator (discussed in paper), a 100kg load cell, and a  1320 lb linear actuator, and a safety enclosure to mount all components
- Programmed scripts to control linear actuator and execute actions via feedback from load cell 
- Documented work by writing a formal research paper and creating poster for the yearly Science Research Fair (both at the bottom of page)

### Results
- Successful in applying a tensile or compressive load to the shoe until target load is met
- Next steps: add a camera for image processing to quantify deformation
