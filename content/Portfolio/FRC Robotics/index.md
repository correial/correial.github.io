The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a rigorous international high school engineering program where teams design, build, and program large-scale robots to complete complex game challenges under strict time, budget, and technical constraints. As Team Captain during my senior year (2022), I was honored to lead my high school FRC robotics team (team 5806) to its first-ever NYC Regional Championship victory, which consequently secured the teamâ€™s first-ever qualification for the World Championships in Houston, TX. Below I expand on our design and results for the 2022 Game, *Rapid React*, sponsored by The Boeing Company.

### Design Goals
- **Active intake** system designed to intake and store two balls (~9" in diameter) at a time until released
- **Shooting the balls** with roughly 80% accuracy into 9 ft vertical hoop (4ft in diameter) while simultaneously traversing the field
- Capable of climbing **6 ft into the air** via the climb structure and suspending for ~2 minutes

### Robot CAD Design
Prior to building our robot, I helped lead the charge on designing our robot in CAD for more streamlined component fabrication and integration. Below are a few angles of the Fusion 360 Robot CAD

### Key Integration Elements
Below are a few key personal contributions that contributed to our final product:
- Facilited inclusive design sessions and led comprehensive design reviews
- Integrated NEO brushless motors and belt systems for shooter, intake, and drivetrain (tank drive used for more stable and powerful robot)
- Collaborated with electrical sub-team to securely mount all motors and electrical components such as LimeLight sensor for vision
- Helped complete pneumatic piston geometry calculations for climb arms, ultimately accomplished via on-board air compressor 
- Operated CNC Mill alongside team lathe, band-saw, belt sander, and other power tools to machine custom parts from CAD and CAM files
