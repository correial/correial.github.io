[Cornell Nexus](https://www.cornellnexus.com/) is a Cornell Engineering Project team currently working on a fully autonamous beach rover to address environmental concerns associated with microplastic pollution. Since joining my Freshman year, I have the opportunity to work on the filtration and drivetrain projects and now lead the fourteen-member mechanical team as Subteam Lead! Here are a few highlights that I have worked on and helped supervise during my time on the team. I will be updating the website with updates on my senior design project next semester Fall 2025!
